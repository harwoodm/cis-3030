<h1>CIS-3030 Homework #5</h1>

<p>Read my OCaml tutorial. In the text read Chapter 15 on functional
programming. You can skip sections 15.5, 15.6, and 15.8.</p>

<p>The questions below ask you to write several functions in OCaml. You do
not need to write complete programs; the functions alone are enough. To test
your code, you can type it into the OCaml top level and then execute it
interactively. To simplify editing you can enter your code into a
<code>.ml</code> file and use the <code>#use</code> directive in the OCaml
top level to load that file. For example "<code>#use myfuns.ml;;</code>" will
load the code in <code>myfuns.ml</code> into the top level. You do not need
to separately compile the <code>.ml</code> file.</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>The Fibonacci sequence is 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... It is
    defined as follows: <i>F(0) = 0</i>, <i>F(1) = 1</i>, <i>F(n) = F(n-1) +
    F(n-2)</i>. In other words, each item in the sequence is the sum of the
    previous two items. Write a function that computes <i>F(n)</i> for any
    <i>n ≥ 0</i>. Note that the Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially. A
    simple recusive implementation is very slow when <i>n</i> is large. Don't
    worry about that.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Write two versions of a function that computes the product of all
    the values in a list. For example, given the list [2; 2; 4; 4] the
    function should return 2*2*4*4 = 64. The first version should use the
    library <code>List.fold_left</code> function. The second version should
    not use <code>fold_left</code> but instead iterate down the list using a
    recursive helper function (that you'll need to write). The helper
    function should take two parameters: a "product so far" and the remaining
    list to process. For example given 4 and [5; 6], the helper function
    should return 4*5*6 = 120. The helper function should use pattern
    matching to break the given list into a head element and a tail list, and
    then call itself recursively to process the tail appropriately.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>(Tricky) Write a function <code>unzip</code> that takes a list of
    pairs, and returns a pair of lists where each list in the return value is
    composed of the corresponding elements from the input list. For example,
    given [(1, 2); (3, 4); (5, 6)], <code>unzip</code> should return ([1; 3;
    5], [2; 4; 6]). Hint: Use pattern matching to break the input list into
    head and tail sections. Apply <code>unzip</code> to the tail in a nested
    <code>let... in</code> expression.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>(Tricky) Write a function <code>zip</code> that does the opposite
    from <code>unzip</code> above. For example, given a pair of lists ([1; 3;
    5], [2; 4; 6]), <code>zip</code> should return the list of pairs [(1, 2);
    (3, 4); (5, 6)]. If the given lists are of unequal length,
    <code>zip</code> should only process elements that are matched, ignoring
    the "extra" elements in the longer list.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
