<h1>CIS-3030 Homework #6</h1>

<p>For information on Python consult the documentation on the main Python web
site. The page at <a
href="http://www.python.org/doc/">http://www.python.org/doc/</a> contains
links to a Python tutorial and also reference manuals for the language and
library. The tutorial is detailed and reasonably well written, but it is also
fairly long. I encourage you to read sections of it, but you'll want to
browse the table of contents for the sections that are most relevant to
you.</p>

<p>You should also browse over the book Learning Python on <a
href="https://libraries.vsc.edu/proxy/onoffproxylinks.asp?campus=VTC&amp;db=SAFARI">VTC's
Safari site</a>. The book is an excellent introduction to the language and
covers both basic and advanced topics.</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and computes
    the average of all values in the list, the minimum value in the list, and
    the maximum value in the list. Your function should return these results
    in a tuple.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Write a Python program that outputs a list of all files in the
    current directory and all subdirectories recursively. You will want to
    use the <code>os.listdir()</code> and the <code>os.path.isdir()</code>
    functions. Consult the Python documentation for more information. Hint:
    Write a recursive function that scans the current directory and calls
    itself for each subdirectory it finds. The function should return of all
    the files it discovers, together with the files discovered by the
    recursive calls. (Imagine that this program is part of a larger backup
    utility of some kind)</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Sometimes it is useful to enforce a limit on the size of a list.
    Write a Python class named <code>BoundedList</code>, in a module named
    <code>bounded.py</code>, that encapsulates an ordinary list but prevents
    the list from growing larger than a given size. The size to be used
    should be a parameter of the class constructor (so different instances
    could have different sizes). Your class should provide a method named
    <code>append()</code> that can be used to append new items to the bounded
    list. You should also define the <code>__len__()</code>,
    <code>__getitem__()</code>, and <code>__setitem__()</code> methods. These
    methods will allow you to use a BoundedList much like an ordinary list.
    See section 3.4.5 in the language reference manual for more details.
    Write a short program that demonstrates your class.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
