# SUBJECT   : Program to print temperature conversion table.
# PROGRAMMER: (C) Copyright 2002 by Peter Chapin
#
# This program prints out a F -> C temperature conversion table. It accepts as input the bounds
# of the table and the step size between table rows. It allows for both increasing and
# decreasing ranges (use a negative step for a decreasing range).
#
# To do:
#
# + There is something not quite right about the interactive input section. It seems to print
#   out extra spaces at the start of each line but the first.
#
# + Need to add the ability to get input parameters from the command line.
#
# + The duplication of the while loops at the bottom seems bad. Is there a good, Python way of
#   dealing with that? I'm thinking about creating a function object that handles the condition.
#   I could create the function object two different ways depending on the input range.
#
# + It might be neat to make the precision of the output a command line option as well. I'd have
#   to dynamically construct the format string. That shouldn't be a problem.
